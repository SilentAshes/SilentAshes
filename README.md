Welcome to my GitHub repository! This space documents my journey as a cybersecurity student with a strong passion for Security Operations Centers (SOCs). Here, you'll find projects, scripts, and resources that showcase my skills and dedication to building and maintaining effective security defenses.

## About Me üßë‚Äçüíª

I'm a cybersecurity student deeply interested in the operational aspects of security. My focus lies in understanding and implementing proactive and reactive security measures to protect systems and data from evolving threats. I believe in continuous learning and hands-on experience to master the art of threat detection and response.

## Skills & Technologies üõ†Ô∏è

* **Programming Languages:** Python, C, PowerShell
* **Operating Systems:** Linux (Ubuntu, Kali), Windows
* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
* **Cloud Platforms:** Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
* **Scripting & Automation:** Automating security tasks, log analysis, and incident response
* **Threat Detection & Analysis:** Identifying and analyzing security threats and vulnerabilities

## Projects üìÇ

Here are some of the projects I'm working on or have completed:

* **Automated File Integrity Monitoring FIM  (PowerShell):** Leveraged Power-Shell scripting to automate file integrity verification processes, significantly strengthening the organization's overall security framework.
* **Web Automation Instagram bot (Python):** This project involved exploring the capabilities of web automation tools like Selenium. I learned how to control a web browser programmatically to interact with various elements on a webpage. This could be useful for tasks like data scraping (with permission) or testing web applications (within ethical guidelines)
* **ELK Stack Configuration & Dashboards:** Implemented an Elastic Stack SIEM home lab with Kali Linux event generation and Elastic Agent log collection. Created dashboards and alerts for security event analysis and incident response.
* **Custom Intrusion Detection System (C):** Developing a basic IDS for learning purposes **(under devlopment)**
