## üìÇ Projects

Here are some of the **hands-on projects** I‚Äôm working on or have completed:

- **[Automated File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) with PowerShell](https://github.com/SilentAshes/FIM/):**  
  Designed a script for automating file integrity checks to enhance organizational security. This script monitors critical system files and alerts on any unauthorized changes.

- **[Web Automation with Python (Instagram Bot)](https://github.com/SilentAshes/IG-BOT/):**  
  Explored **Selenium** for web automation. This bot automates interactions with Instagram (for ethical purposes) and can be extended for testing web applications.

- **ELK Stack Configuration & Dashboards:**  
  Set up an **ELK Stack** to simulate a SIEM environment with **Kali Linux** event generation. Created custom dashboards for log analysis and security event monitoring.

- **[Custom Intrusion Detection System (C) - Under Development](https://github.com/SilentAshes/Custom-IDS):**  
  A simple IDS built in C to detect suspicious activities, such as port scanning and denial-of-service attempts. This project is still in the development phase.

- **[BugztackV0.1 - Under Development](https://github.com/SilentAshes/BugztackV0.1):**  
  Bugztack streamlines the setup of essential cybersecurity tools‚Äîcovering both Red Team (offensive) and Blue Team (defensive) needs‚Äîdirectly from your web browser. Say goodbye to tedious manual installations and hello to 
  faster, more efficient lab environments.

## üöÄ Future Goals: Building the Future of Cybersecurity

As I continue my journey into the world of cybersecurity, here are some of my **key objectives** and **aspirations** for the future:

1. **Obtain Advanced Cybersecurity Certifications:**
   - I plan to pursue certifications like **CompTIA Security+**, **Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH)**, **eCIR (eLearnSecurity Certified Incident Responder)**, and **GSOC (GIAC Security Operations Center Analyst)**. These certifications will help me solidify my knowledge and make me a more effective professional in the field of SOCs.

2. **Contribute to Open-Source Security Projects:**
   - Open-source projects have always been an essential part of my learning process. Moving forward, I want to contribute more actively to high-impact **security tools** and **SIEM solutions** to help strengthen the cybersecurity community and gain exposure to real-world scenarios.

3. **Gain Hands-On Experience in a SOC Environment:**
   - A major milestone in my journey is to gain real-world experience by working in a **Security Operations Center (SOC)**. This will provide valuable insights into **incident detection, response**, and **forensics** while allowing me to develop expertise in **log analysis**, **threat hunting**, and **automated defenses**.

4. **Mentor Future Cybersecurity Professionals:**
   - As I advance in my career, I aim to give back to the community by mentoring aspiring cybersecurity professionals. Sharing my knowledge through workshops, online courses, and forums will allow me to contribute to the growth of the next generation of cybersecurity experts.

5. **Stay Ahead of Emerging Cybersecurity Trends:**
   - Cybersecurity is a rapidly evolving field, and I am committed to staying at the cutting edge. Whether it's **Zero Trust Architecture**, **Quantum Security**, or **Blockchain Security**, I plan to continuously research and adapt to emerging trends to future-proof my skills and expertise.
